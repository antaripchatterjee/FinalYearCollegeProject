# Final year college project - Wireless home appliance controller

A simple yet advance tool for controlling home appliances with a cell phone that supports WiFi 2.4 GHz.

### College and Department

Group - 1, ECE (2014-18)\
[Narula Institute of Technology](https://www.nit.ac.in/).

### Team members (developers)

* Purbasha Ray (26)
* Antarip Chatterjee (27)
* Debmalya Basu (28)
* Anushika (30)

> *`P.S. Above bracketed numbers were not our age but our roll no, and yes, we betrayed 29.`*` 😜`

### Distinctiveness

* The best part about our project, it was very pocket friendly. It did not even cost us 1200 rupees including documentations.
* Unlike any other teams who used ![bluetooth](https://github.com/antaripchatterjee/FinalYearCollegeProject/blob/master/bluetooth.png), we used ![Wi-Fi](https://github.com/antaripchatterjee/FinalYearCollegeProject/blob/master/wifi.png) technology as wireless network. We even tested our control range from almost 20 meters apart (did not measure).
* Scaling feature was one of the key factor for us. Spend just a little money to purchase a SIPO register and support eight more AC appliances.

### Things we had to buy
* **NodeMCU with ESP8266 microcontroller** (Yep, we were supposed to write codes in lua but who cared? 😒 We flashed our own firmware.) 
* **IC 74HC595** (16 PINs SIPO shift register)
* **5V/9V DC OUT adapter** (Did not have time to make our own. 😐)
* **AC relay switches** (Some type of automatic electrical switch though don't know how it works but it worked and nobody cared again. 😶)
* **PCB board** (I do not have to explain anything. 🙃)
* **IC holders** (Some smarta** decisions 😎 or nerd like 🤓)
* **Resistors** (Resistor, not register 😑)
* **Connecting and soldering wires** (Did we buy these or did we borrow from someone? 🤔)
* **Bulbs with a switchless socket board** (Indeed for test, we used AC relays! 💡💡💡💡)

### Contribution
No, thank you! You can fork, clone or do whatever you want. Again nobody cares. 😶
